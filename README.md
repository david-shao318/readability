# readability: An Artistic e-Reader

Using two OpenAI APIs, GPT-3 and DALLE-2, we built an online e-reader that allows you to create aesthetic visuals on demand, based on a particular passage in your text.

By highlighting a passage of text, artwork can be generated in a story book style, which allows you to switch between them as you read. See a demo here: [https://youtu.be/SjORCRD2S9E](https://youtu.be/SjORCRD2S9E).

Built using Flask and native JavaScript, with a custom designed style sheet and color palette.

Originally built as part of HackPrinceton 2022.
